## [Unreleased] - 2023-11-11
### Added
(Poikilos)
- Make a loop to add bears with less code.
- Giant panda plushy (texture & code for existing bear model)
- Aliases to fix plushies in worlds already using the mod (old "cat_plushies" namespace)

### Changed
(Poikilos)
- Change namespace from cat_plushies to plushies.
- Make node names consistent (and add aliases for worlds that ran an older version).

### Fixed
(Poikilos)
- Fix the hamster recipe (was overwriting polar bear recipe so there was no hamster recipe).
- Make spacing consistent.
- Simplify descriptions.
- Fix spelling of hamster icon.
- Rename images using Minetest conventions to avoid conflicts (Add namespace to beginning of each texture filename).
- Make inventory icons square to avoid distortion.
  - That fix and making hamster smaller also makes hamster recognizable.
- Make polar bear inventory image lighter to match actual appearance.
